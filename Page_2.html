		&emsp;The best way to explain it is with an analogy. Say you are tasked with 
		protecting a bank from robberies. You can try your best but there might be 
		some things you missed. As such you might hire a robber to try to break 
		in. He could then tell you what he did to get past you and you could try to 
		fix the problem. This would ensure that any subsequent robbers who were 
		real wouldn't be able to get in the same way.<br>
		&emsp;This is the same model used for cybersecurity. Because the cyber space is so 
		abstract it can be very difficult for cybersecurity professionals to anticipate 
		the actions of malicious actors. This is where ethical hacking comes in. <br>
		&emsp;Ethical hackers can attempt to find chinks in the armor of these systems and 
		services in order to develop defenses prior to an attack. Without ethical 
		hackers, your data would be protected by extremely flimsy security and could 
		fall victim to any hacker with sufficiently advanced skills.
