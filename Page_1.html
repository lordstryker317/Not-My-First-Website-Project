		&emsp;Ethical or "White-hat" hacking is the act of breaking, bypassing, and
 		exploiting flaws in digital security on systems after receiving express 
		permission from those being attacked. Every major company worth their salt 
		employs such hackers to attempt to exploit their security. The main 
		differences between this and what is known as malicious or "Black-hat" 
		hacking is that permission is obtained—making it legal—and the hackers are 
		hired by the ones they hack.
